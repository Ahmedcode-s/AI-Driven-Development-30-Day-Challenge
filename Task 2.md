# 🌐 AIDD 30-Day Challenge - Task 2
## 📁Part A — Theory (Short Questions)
### 1. Nine Pillars Understanding
#### Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks better for your growth as a system architect?
AI agents repetitive kaam handle kar lete hain, jisse aapke pass free time hota hai to focus on architecture, design decisions, and strategic thinking jo real growth skills hain for a system architect.
#### Explain how the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped Developer ? 
Nine Pillars of AIDD repetitive aur complex tasks simplify karte hain, jisse coding, testing aur debugging fast aur easy ho jata hai, aur AI agents tools ke saath efficiently kaam karte hain. Is process se developer ki skills broaden hoti hain, aur woh gradually M-Shaped Developer ban jata hai

### 2. Vibe Coding vs Specification-Driven Development
#### Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?
Vibe Coding ka sabse bada masla yeh hai ke developer ko code ki internal workings ka clear idea nahi hota. Errors track karna mushkil ho jata hai aur problem ki asal wajah samajh nahi aati. Kai dafa ek choti bug ko solve karne mein bhi kaafi waqt lag jata hai. Is tarah development slow aur confusing ho jati hai.
#### How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?
Specification-Driven Development se pehle se clear guidelines aur rules define hote hain ke code ko kaise likhna hai aur expected behavior kya hoga. Isse developer ko har step par clarity milti hai, errors easily trace hote hain, aur bugs jaldi solve ho jate hain.

### 3. Architecture Thinking
#### How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?
AIDD ke aane se developer ka role ab sirf coding tak limited nahi raha. Ab unka main kaam hai system ka structure design karna, workflows aur data flows plan karna, aur overall architecture ko strong banana.
#### Explain why developers must think in layers and systems instead of raw code.
Developers ke liye important hai ke woh layers aur systems level par sochein, na ke sirf raw code.
AI repetitive coding handle karta hai, jisse developer architecture, data flows aur design par focus kar sakta hai, aur programs smarter, scalable aur efficient bante hain.
